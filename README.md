# Project #3: <en> Where to Go?

## **About the project**

In our final project, we created an e-commerce in the travel service area, focused on those who are looking for an experience beyond the traditional packages offered by travel agencies. Our product offers a special route to a vast number of destinations around the world.
Some already know where they are going and others are inspired by our experiences. But everyone experiences a great adventure.

**Where To Go** It works like this, the person chooses the destination and receives a surprise itinerary in the "treasure hunt" model with places to be visited sequentially, finding clues along the way. The locations and activities are curated by our team and include packages that adapt to any travel group; from a solo traveler to a large group of people.
